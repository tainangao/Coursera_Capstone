## Residential Apartment Sales Price and Venues Analysis of Manhattan

When people consider buying residential apartments, what they often take into consideration are the price and what the neighborhood has to offer. In this project, I will
1. plot a Choropleth using Folium library, a GeoJson file, Google Geocoding API, and Shapely library
2. cluster all the neighborhoods in Manhattan into 5 clusters using Folium library, Foursquare API, and K-means
