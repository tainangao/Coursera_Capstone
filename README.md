# Coursera_Capstone
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate capstone project


In this repository, you can see 2 Python notebooks:
- Neighborhood classification of Toronto
- Residential Apartment Sales Price and Venues Analysis of Manhattan 

The Toronto Jupyter Notebook is independent, while the rest of the documents in this repository are all related to the Manhattan project.

Please check out 'Neighborhoods in Manhattan-no output.ipynb' to view the codes.

I also wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@jacqueline3749/residential-apartment-sales-price-and-venues-analysis-of-manhattan-1a0ab261d5a9) about this project, please check it out =)

You could also check out 'Residential Apartment Sales Price and Venues Analysis of Manhattan.ipynb' to view the codes with outputs, but it will take a long time to load.
